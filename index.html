    <h1>I felt a Funeral in my Brain</h1>
    <h2>Poem 280 </h2>
    <h3>Emily Dickinson<em> 1899</em></h3>

    <p>
    I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,
    And Mourners to and fro
    Kept treading - treading - till it seemed
    That Sense was breaking through -
    </p>
    <p>
    And when they all were seated,
    A Service, like a Drum -
    Kept beating - beating - till I thought
    My mind was going numb -
    </p>
    <p>
    And then I heard them lift a Box
    And creak across my Soul
    With those same Boots of Lead, again,
    Then Space–began to toll,
    </p>
    <p>
    As all the Heavens were a Bell,
    And Being, but an Ear,
    And I, and Silence, some strange Race,
    Wrecked, solitary, here -
    </p>
    <p>
    And then a Plank in Reason, broke,
    And I dropped down, and down–
    And hit a World, at every plunge,
    And Finished knowing–then–
    </p>
