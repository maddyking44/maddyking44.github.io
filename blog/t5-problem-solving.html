 <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
    <p>
      Once upon a time a nomad was traversing the cliffs of code when she was impeded by a simple problem: Counting the dots in the dot game.
    </p>
    <p>
      To solve the problem I routinely explained my logic out loud, as though to a friend, while pacing around my apartment. I also ran the script in my browser and read the error messages in the inspector, which was very helpful as it told me which lines the problems sat on.I tried a bunch of different methods according to different logics I figured out in my head. I read back through old exercises and challenges and the reader info given to us. A lot of my problems were to do with making arrays so I googled to understand the proper syntax and understand arrays through different words. It took a long time but I was very proud when I solved the challenge, and learned a lot more about loops, arrays and javascript.
