 <h3>Learnings from "Search Inside Yourself"</h3>
    <p>
     I really enjoyed this chapter, and it came at an opportune time for me. I think the use of the term 'triggers' is a bit loose since it's usually used to apply to very real trauma that you can't just 'treat as a sitcom'.
     But I think the strategy of stopping, breathing and reflecting on where the feeling is coming from, and practicing kindness is really beneficial.
     In coding I think my bad patterns is thinking I don't know how to do something before I start. But when I read through and remember my notes I realise I do have the tools to solve a problem.
     Another one is the panic of feeling like I don't have enough time.
     I will try this approach to respond to these feelings.
