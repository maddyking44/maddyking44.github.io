    <p>
    I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, <br>
    And Mourners to and fro <br>
    Kept treading - treading - till it seemed <br>
    That Sense was breaking through - <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    And when they all were seated, <br>
    A Service, like a Drum - <br>
    Kept beating - beating - till I thought <br>
    My mind was going numb - <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    And then I heard them lift a Box <br>
    And creak across my Soul <br>
    With those same Boots of Lead, again, <br>
    Then Space–began to toll, <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    As all the Heavens were a Bell, <br>
    And Being, but an Ear, <br>
    And I, and Silence, some strange Race, <br>
    Wrecked, solitary, here - <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    And then a Plank in Reason, broke,<br>
    And I dropped down, and down –<br>
    And hit a World, at every plunge,<br>
    And Finished knowing–then– <br>
    </p>
