 <h3>Responsive</h3>
  <p>
    A responsive site changes its layout to suit the size of a device. All sites should be clear and readable on a mobile as well as a big desktop - which sometimes means certain elements need to be resized, rearranged or removed completely.
  </p>
<h3>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</h3>
  <p>
    I think good desiign these days starts with the mobile design first so the mobile design doesn't have to navigate lots of unneccesary CSS.
  </p>
<h3> Frameworks</h3>
  <p>
    Frameworks are out-of-the-boxs tools that do a lot of the ground work for you to make a nice design. If you fit in with their rules you can create beautiful looking pages using frameworks. Unfortunately I don't like fitting in with assigned rules. The big con for me was not being able to edit the skeleton CSS (as we were linking to an online stylesheet)so I had to continuously find workarounds to hack the trickier things I wanted, which in the end won't make for good code. This system today of having 3 stylesheets on top of each other seems complicated and breakable.
  </p>
<h3> Wireframes</h3>
  <p>
    Wireframes are very very simple layout-based pictures that help clients get an idea of what a designer is thinking; help designers figure out how their layout will work in code; and help developers code a design.

  <h3>Difficulties</h3>
    <p>
      I couldn't centre the image in the middle of the page- I think it's aligned to the left of its grid square. I tried aligninging the image element in html, aligning the div, and aligning the element in CSS and nothing worked. I guess it's the float: left property in the skeleton css? I experimented alot with the utility classes to get the images to look how I wanted them to, but I still don't compeltely understand the difference between u-max-full-width (the full width of the grid square, I guess, depending on what's in the other grid squares?) and u-full-width, as both are set to 100% in the CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having a range of different sized images and trying to get them all to look consistent in terms of size was another challenge. And getting these different sized images (some square and some rectangle) to responsively grow and shrink with the page size. The percentage size values I wanted to asign to the images seemed to clash with the skeleton grid.
      I'd love to know if that flex-box stuff we learned last sprint is still useful, if it was trash, whether and why skeleton is better, whether we can use both at once in the same grid, etc. I just always want to know how to get elements to stack on a mobile screen. The flex-wrap property allowed for that. How is skeleton doing it? I'm also interested in the skeleton media queries, like it sets parameters for devices larger than 400px but where's the original code for devices smaller than that, or how does the browser know how to interpret it for tiny screens.
